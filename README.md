added script to idempotently install it as a daily cron task.

```

## Contributing

* Before contributing a new feature, open a GitHub issue to propose and discuss
  it. I appreciate contributions, but in the end I still have to maintain them,
  so I might not want to accept every single one.

* Follow thoughtbot's [Git Protocol] for pull requests. Keep PRs focused (only
  containing a single feature, bug fix, etc.)

* **Licensing:** By contributing to this project you assert that the
  contribution is solely your own intellectual property, and agree to grant me a
  royalty-free, unconditional, irrevocable license to use it for any purpose,
  including sublicensing it under the project's [LICENSE].

* **Conduct:** Be kind and respectful to fellow contributors. Anyone who engages
  in abusive, harassing, or otherwise hurtful behavior will be swiftly and
  permanently removed from all project spaces. See the [Contributor Covenant]
  for examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Reports sent to
  <alex@grantovich.net> will be handled confidentially.
